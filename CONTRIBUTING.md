# Contributing

Please create a PR with your proposed testcases. The testcases will be reviewed and merged if they meet the requirements. You may also open an issue to discuss the testcase before creating a PR, or upload it there if you do not know how to create a PR.

If an issue is found with a testcase, please create an issue with the testcase name and a description of the issue, using the issue tracker.

## Creating a Testcase

To create a template for a testcase, run `test.py create`

## Creating a Pull Request (PR)

A GitHub account is required to make a PR. If you do not have a GitHub account, you may create an issue using the template provided in the issue tracker.

To create a PR, please follow the steps below:

 - On the GitHub page [lo9ud/RW214-project-testcases](https://github.com/lo9ud/RW214-project-testcases) click on the `Fork` button to fork the repository.
 - Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
 - Make your changes.
 - Commit and push your changes to your forked repository.
 - On the GitHub page of your forked repository, click on the `Pull Request` button to create a PR.
 - Fill in the PR template and submit the PR.
 - The PR will be reviewed and merged if it meets the requirements.
   - This will include an automated check to ensure that the testcase(s) are correctly structured.
 - If the PR is accepted, the changes will be merged into the main repository, and you may delete your forked repository.

Do not submit too many PR's, as this will make it difficult to review them. If you have multiple testcases to submit, please include them in a single PR.
